 * The French short labels follow the **Alliance Française school
 * convention** uniformly across all six levels: Élémentaire 1 / 2,
 * Intermédiaire 1 / 2, Avancé 1 / 2. §8.2 lists four institutional
 * conventions (Service-Public.gouv.fr 3-tier, Eduscol CEFR-bracketed,
 * Beacco/Didier bare codes, Alliance Française school convention) and
 * directs Epic 10.7 to pick one and apply it uniformly. Alliance
 * Française was chosen because it (a) preserves the existing 3-family
 * structure (Élémentaire / Intermédiaire / Avancé), (b) uses a natural
 * "1" / "2" sub-level distinguisher between A1↔A2, B1↔B2, C1↔C2, and
 * (c) is familiar to French-as-a-foreign-language students. The
 * pre-10-7 `nameFr: "Élémentaire avancé"` for A2 was non-canonical
 * (closest match was the CEFR Companion Volume's informal A2+) and
 * `nameFr: "Maîtrise"` for C2 mixed in an Eduscol parenthetical
 * descriptor — both replaced for convention-uniformity.
