/**
 * Story 14-3: centralised icon-set wrapper.
 *
 * Closes audit roadmap line 272 (icon system replacement). Wraps
 * `@expo/vector-icons.Feather` (already transitive via Expo SDK 55 — zero
 * install cost) so the icon-set choice is centralised in 1 file. Future
 * swap (e.g., to `lucide-react-native`) is 1-file change, not 33-site.
 *
 * Mirrors the consolidation discipline from Story 14-2 (SkillCard +
 * ListItemCard single source-of-truth) and the chrome/content split from
 * Story 14-1 (chrome icons get real icons; learning-content emoji stay
 * verbatim per `TOPIC_EMOJIS` + onboarding goal emoji).
 *
 * **Why a typed `IconName` union?** `<Feather name="mial" />` (typo) would
 * silently render a missing-glyph placeholder at runtime; the union catches
 * the typo at `tsc` time. Adding a new icon usage requires extending the
 * union FIRST — drift detector pins ≥ 20 members so a careless removal
 * breaks CI.
 *
 * **Why `React.memo`?** Consistent with `SkillCard` / `ListItemCard` /
 * `Bubble` precedents — Icon is rendered in lists / cards / chrome
 * affordances that re-render on parent state changes; the wrapper memo
 * defends against unnecessary re-renders.
 *
 * **Accessibility default**: when `accessibilityLabel` is omitted, the icon
 * is treated as decorative-of-text so screen-readers don't announce
 * "envelope, U+2709" beside an "Email" TextInput that already has its own
 * label.
 *
 * **Story 14-3 review-round-1 P1 (HIGH) — cross-platform a11y**:
 * `importantForAccessibility` is an Android-only prop in React Native; on
 * iOS it's a no-op. VoiceOver would still discover the icon as a focusable
 * element. The pre-R1 implementation only set `importantForAccessibility="no"`
 * which silently regressed iOS a11y (auth-surface mail/lock/user icons
 * announced beside the labeled TextInput). Post-R1 the decorative branch
 * sets THREE props: `accessible={false}` (iOS canonical decorative flag),
 * `accessibilityElementsHidden={true}` (iOS-strong hide; tree-walked by
 * VoiceOver), `importantForAccessibility="no"` (Android canonical). Mirrors
 * the same pattern Story 14-2 used in `PasswordStrengthIndicator.tsx:152-156`.
 *
 * Consumers that need the icon announced as its own element pass
 * `accessibilityLabel` explicitly.
